# GitBrain
Visualizing GitHub Contributions in 3D

GitBrain is a 3D interactive brain visualization that maps your GitHub contributions as neurons firing over time.

Features:
3D brain model with interactive rotation and zoom.
Neurons represent contributions: color and size indicate activity level.
Animated connections (axons) showing contribution flow between neurons.
Time-based animation: watch your contributions light up week by week.
